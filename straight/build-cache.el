First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If

package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If

package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,

the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

Usage:

  (use-package package-name
     [:keyword [option]]...)

:init            Code to run before PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.
:config          Code to run after PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.  Note that
                 if loading is deferred for any reason, this code does not
                 execute until the lazy load has occurred.
:preface         Code to be run before everything except `:disabled'; this
                 can be used to define functions for use in `:if', or that
                 should be seen by the byte-compiler.

:mode            Form to be added to `auto-mode-alist'.
:magic           Form to be added to `magic-mode-alist'.
:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:commands        Define autoloads for commands that will be defined by the
                 package.  This is useful if the package is being lazily
                 loaded, and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:autoload        Similar to :commands, but it for no-interactive one.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
                 *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the
                 package.  This is like `:bind', but for keymaps.
:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:defer           Defer loading of a package -- this is implied when using
                 `:commands', `:bind', `:bind*', `:mode', `:magic', `:hook',
                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:after           Delay the effect of the use-package declaration
                 until after the named libraries have loaded.
                 Before they have been loaded, no other keyword
                 has any effect at all, and once they have been
                 loaded it is as if `:after' was not specified.

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `Custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable
                 definition without modifying the Emacs `custom-file'.
                 (compare with `custom-set-variables').
:custom-face     Call `custom-set-faces' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin             Pin the package to an archive.
:vc              Install the package directly from a version control system
                 (using `package-vc.el').

Flymake is an Emacs minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.
Flymake collects diagnostic information from multiple sources,
called backends, and visually annotates the buffer with the
results.

Flymake performs these checks while the user is editing.
The customization variables `flymake-start-on-flymake-mode',
`flymake-no-changes-timeout' determine the exact circumstances
whereupon Flymake decides to initiate a check of the buffer.

The commands `flymake-goto-next-error' and
`flymake-goto-prev-error' can be used to navigate among Flymake
diagnostics annotated in the buffer.

By default, `flymake-mode' doesn't override the \\[next-error] command, but
if you're using Flymake a lot (and don't use the regular compilation
mechanisms that often), it can be useful to put something like
the following in your init file:

  (setq next-error-function \\='flymake-goto-next-error)

The visual appearance of each type of diagnostic can be changed
by setting properties `flymake-overlay-control', `flymake-bitmap'
and `flymake-severity' on the symbols of diagnostic types (like
`:error', `:warning' and `:note').

Activation or deactivation of backends used by Flymake in each
buffer happens via the special hook
`flymake-diagnostic-functions'.

Some backends may take longer than others to respond or complete,
and some may decide to disable themselves if they are not
suitable for the current buffer.  The commands
`flymake-running-backends', `flymake-disabled-backends' and
`flymake-reporting-backends' summarize the situation, as does the
special *Flymake log* buffer.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the `Flymake
mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if
it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate the variable `flymake-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.

This starts a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server suitable for
the buffers of PROJECT whose `major-mode' is among

start and CONTACT specifies how to connect to the server.

Interactively, the command attempts to guess MANAGED-MAJOR-MODES,
CLASS, CONTACT, and LANGUAGE-IDS from `eglot-server-programs',
according to the current buffer's `major-mode'.  PROJECT is
guessed from `project-find-functions'.  The search for active
projects in this context binds `eglot-lsp-context' (which see).

If it can't guess, it prompts the user for the mode and the
server.  With a single \\[universal-argument] prefix arg, it
always prompts for COMMAND.  With two \\[universal-argument], it
also always prompts for MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE.

The LSP server of CLASS is started (or contacted) via CONTACT.
If this operation is successful, current *and future* file
buffers of MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE inside PROJECT become \"managed\"
by the LSP server, meaning the information about their contents is
exchanged periodically with the server to provide enhanced
code-analysis via `xref-find-definitions', `flymake-mode',
`eldoc-mode', and `completion-at-point', among others.

PROJECT is a project object as returned by `project-current'.

CLASS is a subclass of `eglot-lsp-server'.

CONTACT specifies how to contact the server.  It is a
keyword-value plist used to initialize CLASS or a plain list as
described in `eglot-server-programs', which see.
